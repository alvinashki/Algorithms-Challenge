# Story
So, yesterday (November 1 2022). I was having an interview user. But it was a real disaster for me, because when they ask me to solve the problem they gave me, I haven't understand yet about array dimensional and they gave me 15 minutes to get it done. So in the first 5-8 minutes my time wasted just to figure out how to give value for each element. So I only have about 7 minutes left to solve the problem and unluckly I was on half way to solve the problem, but then time was out :(. But of course, after the interview I continue the code for my satisfaction.

## So here it is the question !!<br>
Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals (index summary of the array is always the same). Return value is int (difference between the sums of its diagonals)<br><br>
Examples : <br>
1. [3][3]int{}<br>
1 2 3<br>
3 2 1<br>
1 2 1<br>
The left-to-right diagonal is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 and the right-to-left diagonal is 3 + 2 + 1 = 6, so the difference is 6 - 4 = 2 <br><br>
2. [4][4]int{}<br>
1 2 3 4<br>
4 3 2 1<br>
2 1 2 1<br>
1 2 1 2<br>
The left-to-right diagonal is 1 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 8 and the right-to-left diagonal is 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8, so the difference is 8 - 8 = 0 <br><br>
