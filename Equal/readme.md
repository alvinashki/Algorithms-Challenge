# SNIP-SNAP
Again this time, the question is from the test I did for recruitment test <br><br>
Given a list of random number and our job is to find out any posibility that the summary of each element is equal with the highest value of its element if yes than output should be "true". <br> 
## Example
Input = {5, 2, 5, 1, 4, 19, 5, 9}<br>
Output = true<br>
