# Max-Profit
Again this time, the question is from the test I did for recruitment test <br><br>
Given a list of random number and each number is representing price in usd for the same stuff but in different time. Our job is to find out the biggest profit could make but, if ther's no profit we could make so the return should be -1. <br> 
## Example
Input = {44, 30, 24, 32, 35, 30, 40, 38, 15}<br>
Output = 16<br>
Explanation = we can see from the list that the lowest price is 24 (15 is even lower but we can't sell it again) and 40 is our it's biggest price so 40 - 24 = 16
