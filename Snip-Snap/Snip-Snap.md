# SNIP-SNAP
This time, the question is from the test I did for recruitment test <br><br>
Given a list of number from 1 to 100 and our job is to change every number 3 and it's multiple with "snip", number 5 and it's multiple with "snap, and every multiple of 3 and 5 with "snip-snap". <br> 
## Example
1, 2, snip, 4, snap, snip, 7, 8, snip, snap, 11, snip, 13, 14, snip-snap, .... 100
